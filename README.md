# crop_yield_prediction_regression
Crop Yield Prediction using various ML approaches.(Random-Forest Regressor,Gradient-Boosting Regressor,Decision-Tree Regressor,Support-Vector Regressor)
Problem Statement: Predict crops yield for 10 of most consumed crops worldwide.
Model Prediction is done using multiple ML algorithms and Decision-Tree Regressor gives an accuracy of about 92% and Graphviz is used to create the graph of the Descision Tree.
Python Libraries Used:
i>NumPy 
ii>Pandas 
iii>Matplotlib
iv>Scikit-learn
v>Seaborn 
vi>Pydot
vii>Graphviz

Model created is present in the yield_prediction_model.ipynb.
